									<h2>Synopsis</h2>
								</header>
							</div>
							
							<p>Escape the sewer was a prototype made for a games project in university by myself. The game was created as a rage game focused around a frog escaping the sewer while water was rising. If the frog touched the water it would be a fail adding challenge for the player. The movement was inspired from things such as angry birds as the player drags and leaves go like a slingshot to fire the frog as if its hopping that way. The game was then updated to have a levels mode so the player could choose if they wanted the challenged or a more layed back levels mode </p>

									<h2>Key Contributions</h2>
								</header>
								
								<p>Some key contributiosn were as follows</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The frogs movement system allowing so angle was opposite of where the player dragged and then it takes into accounts disatnce the player cursor is back before leaving go to adjust power this creates a difficult but intuitive movement system for the player to master</li>
									<li>Creating the two different modes so the player can choose from racing against time to reach the top and surive or navigating levels as a frog to win the game . All levels and obstacles created and designed in house by me</li>
									<li>Creating all ui, art and such for the game. All the environemt and such was created and implemeted as a tile map for level design and the frgo itself made by me</li>
