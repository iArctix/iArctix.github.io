									<h2>Synopsis</h2>
								</header>
							</div>
							
							<p>Soulmates is a 2d platformer created for the Lost relic game jam in one week with a friend.The theme for the game was connection so the players aim was to get the 2 characters to reach eachother in each level to complete it. The game has 2 stories with 2 differnt couples one developed by each of us which added new abilities and types of levels for the player to complete.My story was the Connor and Richael story and had a dash ability and a shrinking ability with levels catered to them </p>
