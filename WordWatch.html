									<h2>Key Contributions</h2>
								</header>
								
								<p>This game was made by me solo in my spare time in 3 months some of the key points are as follows</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Combat and tools. 2 differnt tools to gather which are upgradeable and a sword and bow for the player to engage in differnet types of combat depending on their playstyle.</li>
									<li>Resource gathering and management. Each area has different resources all with different level requirements causing the player to have to work through each area to upgrade and become stronger before progressing</li>
									<li>Level design all done by me with each area with a different theme from the mountain, forest and graveayrd and the town area for the player to upgrade and chill out between adventures</li>
									<li>Diverse enemy AI system , with passive neutral and aggresive enemies all with different detection ranges, attack range and damage all done by scriptable obejct and enemy controller scripts</li>
									<li>Enemy ecosystem controller, keeping the right amount of enemies in scene at all time when an enemy is killed its name is called in the enemy spawn function to spanw a new one in the scene creating life in the areas</li>
								</ul>
