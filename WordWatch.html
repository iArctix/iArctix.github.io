									<h2>Synopsis</h2>
								</header>
							</div>
							
							<p>Word Watch is a mobile/ browser game currently in development by myself where i have challenged myself to cover all sides of development from art, sound design and coding. The game is a word finding game where the goal is to find words in the grid to build up a high score. The game draws inspiration from scrabble and word searches to create a nice brain training game. Users can also also complete quests and achievments and are able to see their best game and longest words on their profile. </p>
