									<h2>Synopsis</h2>
								</header>
							</div>
							
							<p>For my Dissertation in university i looked into "The impact of player choice and increased agency in video games and as part of my artifact and the thing i actually developed i created a prototype game that had a lot of player choice in and every choice impacted a personality system that the npcs would referance and would effect different outcomes of the game. The game itself had a few quests with different variations and at the end there was 3 different endings the player could get. This was then tested on participants along with a second version of the game with a lot of the choice and agency removed to see the impct and score differences between the two after the participants answered surveys</p>

									<h2>Key Contributions</h2>
								</header>
								
								<p>The prototype was made fully by me along with the ui aspects but some key mechanics and aspects are as follows</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Personality system storing different values for different stats which were then used and refernaced in quests and dialogue to give the player different responses and outcomes</li>
									<li>A dynamic visual perosnality menu showing the player there stats and relationships to the characters at any time and updated every time a stat was changed </li>
									<li>A dialogue and quest system with 3 different characters who would talk to you differently depending on what quest you were up to and what choices you had made previously with them</li>
									<li>Player feedback systems implemented to incraese agency such as when looking at interactable objects and when stats were chganged displaying them on screen to the player </li>
								</ul>
