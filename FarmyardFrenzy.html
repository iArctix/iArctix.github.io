									<h2>Synopsis</h2>
								</header>
							</div>
							
							<p>Farm yard frenzy was a game made in one week by me and a friend for the brackeys game jam 2024.2. It is a tower defence game themed around a farm where the goal is to protect your prized golden chicken. Place defenses and make upgrades to survive harder and harder waves as more of the wildlfie attacks your barn.  </p>

									<h2>Key Contributions</h2>
								</header>
								
								<p>Some of the key contributions i made and would like to highlight</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Defence placement, i developed the grid placement with different tiles types helping defence placement be organised and defences only allowed in certain areas </li>
									<li>Defence Upgrades, currency can be spent to upgrade different stats for the defences from range to extra damage.</li>
									<li>Menus and ui- All menus and ui was made and developed by me where i tired to create nice intuitive design while keeping up with the art style.</li>
									<li>Online Leaderboard was developed and implemented by me giving players that competitive side try and beat the other players and see how many days they can survive</li>
								</ul>
