									<h2>Synopsis</h2>
								</header>
							</div>
							
							<p>During my final semsester at university worked part time as a QA tester for Bright Star studio testing on their upcoming game Embersword, led by their main QA engineer i was given weekly tasks to carry out such as regression tests, explorative testing in certain areas of the game and keeping test cases updated and relevant. I was shown and taught the best techniques and the ins and outs from the expertise from their lead and by the end was capable of testing and follwing their process of bug reporting and test case managing with ease.  </p>
